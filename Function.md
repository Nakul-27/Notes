# Function
A function $\phi$ that maps $X$ into $Y$ is a relation between $X$ and $Y$ with the property that each $x \in X$ appears as the first member of exactly one ordered pair $(x,y)$ in $\phi$. Note that $X$ is the *domain* and $Y$ is the *codomain*.

Also known as a **map** or a **mapping**.

**Denoted as $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$

## Range
The range of $\phi$ is denoted as 
$$
	\phi[X] = \{\phi(x) | x \in X \}
$$

## One-To-One and Onto
$\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ is *one to one (injective)* if $\phi(x_1) = \phi(x_2)$ only when $x_1 = x_2$

$\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ is *onto (surjective)* $Y$ if the range of $\phi$ is in $Y$.

**If a function is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.**

## Inverse Function
If $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ then $\phi^{-1}: Y \rightarrow X$.
