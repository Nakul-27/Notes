# Monopolistic Market

## Types of Monopolies
### Government Created
A Monopoly that is supported by the Government. Examples can include utility companies such as Edison.

### Natural Monopoly
Occurs when a Single Firm can supply a single good or service to the entire market.

## Monopoly vs Competition
**Monopoly demand curve is the market demand curve since it is the sole producer. (Monopoly IS the market)**

## Monopoly Revenue
*A monopolist's marginal revenue is less than the price of its good.*

When a Monopoly increases the amount that it sells, 2 things happen:
1. *Output Effect:* More output is sold, so total revenue increases.
2. *Price Effect:* Price falls, so total revenue decreases
Note that for competitive firms, there is no price effect since firms sell at the market price, but Monopolies must reduce price when it increases quantity.

## Profit Maximization

*In competitive markets, price equals marginal cost. In monopolized markets, price exceeds marginal cost.*

## Profit
$$
	Profit = (P - ATC) \times Q

## Deadweight Loss
*The Monopolist produces less than the socially efficient quantity of output.*

In terms of the monopolist's price: When a monopolist charges a price that is above marginal cost, some potential consumers value the good at more than its marginal cost but less than the monopolist's price.
