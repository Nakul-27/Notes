# How Rich is Too Rich? Measuring the Riches Line
**Riches Line:** A line distinguishing the Rich from the Super-Rich

## Argument
Society, as a whole, can construct a relative "riches lines." The reason that the line should be a consensus of society is so that way there is no one person that is influencing the line up or down. Also, the line will shift as the needs of the society shift.

## Abstract
**Possible to determine a "Riches Lines"**

## Introduction
Policy proposed by AOC of 70% marginal tax on income above 10 million dollars.

**Riches Line agreed upon by society as a line where those who have above it possess much more wealth than is needed to live a fully-flourishing life.**

*[[Social Indicators Research]]* by Jan Drewnowski suggests an "affluence line."
- **Excessive affluence would lead to social evils such as "deterioration of common honesty standards" and "the decline of a sense of duty among the leading and most affluent professions."**

## Data and Methods

## Results 
*Evaluative Claim* is that the members of a society can agree on the approximate location of a line between the rich and those who have much more than is needed to lead a fully flourishing life. 

Dutch believe that the riches line should be between 1 and 3 million euros.

**"In essence, the riches line is—as is also the poverty line—a social construct: something citizens can debate and policy makers can decide upon, together with input from experts."**
