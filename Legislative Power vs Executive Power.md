# Legislative Power vs Executive Power
## Limiting Presidential Power
Didn't want a Tyrannical Ruler like a Monarch.

Reasoning for a Single Executive explained in [[Federalist Papers]] No. 70. Made sure to constrain his power by checks and balances.

Gave president the Ability to Veto (although could be overturned).

## Selecting the President
Decided on the [[Electoral College]] to provide a check on Voters. Not that way now, but that was the intention.

Initially the one with the most votes was the President and the second most votes was the Vice President.

### Twelfth Amendment
Required electors to cast separate ballots for the President and Vice President. This did away with potential ties between Presidential Candidates
