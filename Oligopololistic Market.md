# Oligopoly
## Characteristics
1. A few Large Sellers

## Duopoly
An Oligopoly with 2 members

*Collusion:* When two or more firms make an agreement over production.
*Cartel:* When two or more firms act in unison to regulate supply (OPEC)

## Equilibrium for an Oligopoly
**Nash Equilibrium:** A situation in which economic actors interacting with one another each choose their best strategy given the strategies that the others have chosen.

*When firms in an oligopoly individually choose production to maximize profit, they produce a quantity of output greater than the level produced by monopoly and less than the level produced under perfect competition. The oligopoly price is less than the monopoly price by greater than the competitive price (which equals marginal cost).*

## Prisoners' Dilemma

Nash Equilibrium: Both people confess since both will pursue their own interests and choose to spend 8 years instead of 20 in prison.

*Cooperation is Individually Irrational, therefore Oligopolies have an incentive to cheat and pursue self-interest.*
