# Interrogating the Legitimacy of Extreme Wealth - A Moral Perspective
## Abstract
Main task is to interrogate the justifications of the sources of income of the wealthy. 

There has been a remarkable return of the rich in many countries over the last 30+ years. This involves a shift not only from labour to capital, but from productive capital to rentiership in the financial and property sectors - and hence **Wealth Extraction.**

## Central Argument
**The rich get most of their income by using control of assets like land and money to siphon off wealth that others produce. That means that most of their income is *unearned.***
- The rich have expanded these sources of unearned income. 
## Introduction
Over the past 30 years, when the 1% got more, the 99% got less. 

### Agreed Upon Premises and Definitions
**Moral Economic Approach:** Defines economies as systems of provisioning, including but going beyond the cash economy. *It takes seriously the indisputable fact that we are all social beings, dependent on others as well as ourselves for our survival and well-being.* 

**No such thing as 'Independently rich'.** Unless there are things for sale, money is worthless. 

**Concerns of a moral economy as an approach include the large differences between *what some are able to get* and *what they contribute, need, and deserve.***
- [[John Rawls]]' *[[A Theory of Justice]]* focusses on what people should get. 
- *What the rich get has to do more with power.*

## Investment
2 uses of the term "Investment:"
1. Use-value/object-oriented definitions: Focus on what is being invested *in.*
2. Exchange-value/'investor'-oriented definitions: Focus on the *financial gains* from an investment. 

## The Earned-Unearned Income Distinction and its Application
*Earned Income* is what employees and self-employed people get from contributing to the production of goods and services
- Not what they deserve necessarily, but their pay is conditional on providing goods and services to others. 

*Unearned Income* is what is earned by controlling an already-existing asset, such as land, that others lack but need or want (think landlord). 
- If it exists, no further production cost, apart from maintenance, is required. 
- Those who receive money do so because they simply can. 
	- People who earn off of this method are known as *Rentiers.*

Note that programs such as welfare is categorized as 'transfers' since they are warranted based off of needs. 

## Sources of Wealth of the Rich
Between 1979-2012, in the US, the top 1% increased their real incomes by 185%, the top 0.1% by 384%, and the top 0.01% by 685% while the rest of the country stayed stagnant. 

A Study of 13 Western capitalist countries showed that there was a 4% increase in wages in the 1970s, yet a less than 1% between 1980 and 2005.

A Study of 16 Capitalist Democracies showed that the growth of average real wages and fringe benefits have increased more slowly than labor productivity. 

Both the UN Conference on Trade and Development and the International Labor Organization show that income from capital gains, unearned income, has gone increasingly to the rich. 

For the 1%, most of their wealth is an 'investment' (2nd Definition). This Jeff Bezos with stock options. 

## Other Moral Economic Critiques of Extreme Wealth
Increase in wealth for the rich has caused a shift in political power to the rich as well. 
- Example is the TTP in which the countries account for 60% of global output. 
	- Anyone who attempts to impose restrictions could be sued in international court. 

## Conclusion
Cultural Aspect: Neoliberalism has infiltrated even deeper into organizational and everyday life, which is changing behaviors and worldviews. 

Continued proportional increase in wealth by the ultra-rich only harms the world (debt, global warming, etc.). Therefore there is a need for a moral economic approach that questions everything and reveals what role the rich are playing.
