# Demand
## Law of Demand
In a [[Market]], When the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded of the good falls and visa versa

## Demand Curve
The Relationship between Price and Quantity Demanded

### Market Demand
Sum of the Individual Demands *horizontally*.

### Shifts in the Demand Curve
Increase = Shift Right
Decrease = Shift Left
##### Factors that Shift Demand
- Price of a **related** good
- Income of consumers
- Taste of consumers
- Number of consumers
- Expectations of consumers

*Normal Good* - If demand falls when Income falls. (Ex: Almost Anything)
*Inferior Good* - If demand rises when Income falls. (Ex: Bus Rides)
*Substitutes* - When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good (Ex: Hot Dogs and Hamburgers)
*Complement* - When a fall in the price of one good raises the demand for another good.

## [[Price Elasticity]] of Demand
When there are *many substitutes for a good, the Price is Elastic* due to people being able to switch to the other good.
*Narrower Categories = More Elastic*
*Long Run = More Elastic*

Contrastingly, when there are *no substitutes for a good, the Price is Inelastic* due to people having to stick with one supplier.
*Broad Categories = Less Elastic*
*Short Run = Less Elastic*

*More substitutes are available in the long run compared to the short run.*
