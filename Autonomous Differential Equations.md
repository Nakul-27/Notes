# Autonomous Differential Equations
Differential Equations that are in the form 
$\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)$

Equilibrium Solutions are where $f(y) = 0$

[[Critical Point]]s are values of $y$ that gives  us equilibrium solutions

$\frac{dy}{dt} > 0$ then $y$ is increasing

$\frac{dy}{dt} < 0$ then $y$ is decreasing

Classifications of [[Equilibriums]]
- [[Asymptotically stable]]
	- All nearby solutions approach equilibrium
- [[Stable]]
	- Solutions don't approach or move away from equilibrium (defer)
- [[Semistable]]
	- Some solutions approach and some move away from equilibrium
- [[Unstable]]
	- All nearby solutions move away from equilibrium
