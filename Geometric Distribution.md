# Geometric Distribution 
## Requirements
- [[Binary Variable]] that is [[discrete]]
- No fixed number of trials
- Same probability of "success" on each attempt, $\pi$

## [[Probability]]
The probability that the first "success" happens on the $k$th trial:
$P(y=k)=(1-\pi)^{k-1}\pi$
s
## [[Expected Value]]
$E(Y) = \mu_{Y} = \frac{1}{pi}$
