# Perfectly Competitive Markets
## 4 Characteristics
1. Many Buyers and Sellers
2. Free Entry and Exit
3. Identical Goods
4. Everyone is a [[Price Taker]].

$PRICE = MARGINAL$ $REVENUE = AVERAGE$ $REVENUE$ 

**Shutdown**: A *short-run* decision not to operate during a specific period of time because of current market conditions.

**Exit**: A *long-run* decision to leave the market permanently

**Sunk-Cost Fallacy**: When making a decision to shut down, any fixed costs have already outlayed are sunk cost, so there is an option to operate at *less* of a loss.

## Firms in Perfectly Competitive Markets
3 Features:
1. The marginal cost curve slopes upwards 
2. The average total cost curve is U-shaped
3. The marginal-cost curve crosses the average total cost curve at the minimum of average total cost. 
Note that the price line is horizontal since firms are *price-takers* and that $P = AR = MR$.

3 Rules for Profit Maximization
1. If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, the firm should increase its output
2. If marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue, the firm should decrease its output
3. At the profit-maximizing level of output, marginal revenue equals marginal cost. 

Shut Down (Short Run) if:
1. $TR < VC$
2. $\frac{TR}{Q} < \frac{VC}{Q}$
3. $P < AVC$

Exit (Long Run) if:
1. $TR < TC$
2. $\frac{TR}{Q} < \frac{TC}{Q}$
3. $P < ATC$

Enter (Long Run) if:
1. $P > ATC$

### Profit
We can write the equation for profit as:
$$
\begin{align*}
	Profit &= TR - TC \\
	Profit &= (\frac{TR}{Q} - \frac{TC}{Q}) \times Q \\
	Profit &= (P - ATC) \times Q
\end{align*}
$$

 **In the Long Run, firms make Zero-Profit to the Economist and Positive-Profit to the Accountant.**

 Reasons for an Upward Sloping Supply Curve:
 1. Some resources used in production may be available only in limited quantities. 
 2. Firms may have different costs. 

*Since firms can enter and exit the market easier in the long run, the long run curve is more elastic than the short run curve.*
