# Consumer Surplus
The difference between a buyer's willingness to pay (what the item is worth to the buyer) and the price the buyer actually pays

**When an Individual is talking about willing to pay up to Price X for a product, they bought it at Price Y.**
## Equation
$Consumer$ $Surplus$ = $Maximum$ $Price$ $Willing$ $-$ $Actual$ $Price$
