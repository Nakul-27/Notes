## Federalist 08 - Alexander Hamilton
**Consequences of Hostilities Between the States**
Conflict is unavoidable. As a result, if a confederation was maintained, Standing Armies would be inevitable. If a Union were maintained, with a strong volunteer militia under a national commander-in-chief, the country wouldn't need a standing army.

### Federalist 10 - James Madison
**Factions**
The only way to eliminate factions would be to either curtail liberty or the to make everyone the same - **First remedy is worse than the disease** and **Second as impracticable as the first would be unwise**.

### Federalist 51 - James Madison
**Human Nature is driven by self-interest**
- "in framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself." 

## Federalist 57 - James Madison
**"Refine and Enlarge the Debate" to encompass the common good *and* represent their local constituents.**
"The aim of every political constitution is, or ought to be, first to obtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom to discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common good of society."

## Federalist 70 - Alexander Hamilton
**Single Executive the Best Choice**
A single executive would have the most "energy, dispatch, and responsibility for the office"

## Federalist 78 - Alexander Hamilton
**Supreme Court is the Least Dangerous**
It doesn't have the power of the purse or the power of the sword.
