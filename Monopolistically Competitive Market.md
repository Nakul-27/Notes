# Monopolistically Competitive Market
**Monopolistic Competition:** is a market structure in which there are many firms selling similar by not identical products. Each firm has a monopoly over the product it makes, but many other firms make similar products that compete for the same customers. 

## 4 Characteristics
1. Many Sellers
2. Free Entry
3. Product Differentiation

Many firms compete for the same group of customers. Additionally, each firm produces a product that is at least slightly different from that of other firms. 

**Monopolistically Competitive firms are NOT price takers** therefore they face a downward-sloping demand curve. 


$PRICE =$ $AVERAGE$ $TOTAL$ $COST$ in the long run for monopolistically competitive firms because firms earn zero profit. However, a monopolistically competitive firm sets $Price > MARTINAL$ $COST$  which means that $PRICE =$ $AVERAGE$ $TOTAL$ $COST >$ $MARGINAL$ $COST$ in the long run.

## Short Run
Downward sloping demand curve due to product differentiation.

## Long Run
As firms make profit, new firms enter which causes profits to decreases which causes firms to exit the market which causes profits to rise and the cycle to repeat itself. 

Note that Demand is tangent to the Average Total Cost at the quantity at which $MR = MC$. 

2 Characteristics:
1. Price exceeds marginal cost ($P > MC$) *as in a Monopoly*. This happens because profit maximization requires $MR = MC$ and since the demand curve is downward sloping, $MR < P$.
2. $P = ATC$ *as in a Competitive Market.* This happens because of the free entry and exit which **drive economic profit to zero in the long run.**

## Compared to Perfect Competition

### Excess Capacity
Quantity that minimizes average total cost is called the *efficient scale* of the firm. **In the long run, perfectly competitive firms produce at this level, whereas monopolistically competitive firms produce below this level.** 
Note that this is called *Excess Capacity.*

### Markup over Marginal Cost
In a Perfectly Competitive firm, $P = MC$, whereas in a Monopolistically Competitive Firm, $P > MC$ since the firm always possesses some level of *Market Power.* 

**Monopolistically Competitive Firms are eager to get more customers.**

## Social welfare
2 Types of Externalities:
1. Product-variety Externality: Entry of new firms presents a positive externality since consumers benefit.
2. Business-stealing Externality: Entry of new firms presents a negative externality since new firms steal customers. 
Note that since 1 and 2 oppose each other, depending on which externality is larger, a monopolistically competitive market could either have too few or too many products. 

**Monopolistically Competitive Markets do not have all the desirable welfare properties of perfectly competitive markets. BUT since the inefficiencies are subtle and hard to measure, public policy cannot do anything about it.**

## Brand Names
Critics argue that Brand names cause consumers to perceive differences that do not really exist. 

2 Arguments supporting Brand Names:
1. Provide consumers with *information* about quality when quality cannot be easily judged in advance of purchase. 
2. Give firms *incentive* to maintain high quality because firms have a financial stake in maintaining the reputation of their brand names.
