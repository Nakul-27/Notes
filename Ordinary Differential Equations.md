# Ordinary Differential Equations
## [[Differential Equations]] that are only functions of one variable
### **Solution**: Find Function
Ex: $dy/dt = y$; Find $y(t)$
[[General Solution]]: $y(t) = Ce^t$
[[Particular Solution]]: $y(t) = e^t$
#### Analytical: $y(t)$ (Not always able to be found)
#### Qualitative/Graphical: Understanding what $y(t)$ behaves like. Useful when looking at $n$-order differential Equations
#### Numerical: Using an algorithm to approximate a solution
