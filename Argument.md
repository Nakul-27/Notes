# Argument
*A statement that is intended to prove something.*

**Required: At least One [[Premise]] and One [[Conclusion]].**

#### 1. Deductive 
**[[Validity]] and [[Soundness]]**
Require [[Facts]].

Ex: All men are mortal -> Socrates is a man -> Socrates is Moral.

Own Example:
P1: All mammals are hamsters.
P2: My brother is a mammal.
C: My brother is a hamster.
*Valid but not Sound*

**Modus Ponens**: 
*If p, then q.
p.
Therefore, q.*
**Affirming the Consequence** [[fallacy]]:
*If p, then q.
q.
Therefore p.*

**Modus Tollens**:
*If p, then q.
Not q.
Therefore, not p.*
**Denying the Antecedent** [[fallacy]]:
*If p, then q.
Not p.
Therefore, not q*

**Hypothetical Syllogism**:
*If p, then q.
If q, then r.
Therefore, if p, then r.*
Example: Allow *p* = "it is a car", *q* = "it has wheels", *r* = "it can roll"

#### 2. Inductive 
**[[Strength]] and [[Cogency]]**
Conclusion is more general than the premises provide. *Relies on a sense of Probability*

Observations -> Analysis -> Theory

Own Example:
P1: The Sun has risen since the dawn of time.
P2: Tomorrow is another day.
C: Therefore, The Sun will rise tomorrow.
*Strong and Cogent*

##### Incorrect Moral Argument
![[Pasted image 20220111150358.png]]
- Logical Gap 
###### **HOWEVER** the logic *CAN* be implied
- Such as P1: "Administering a punishment to criminals that does not deter crime is immoral."

#### 4. Refuting and Argument
**Let Reason Rule**
##### Direct
1. Show that at least one of the premises is false
2. Show that the argument isn't valid or strong
3. Show that the conclusion is false

##### Dealing with Non-Moral Premises
- Must be supported by good reasons.
- Determine the reasoning behind believing a Non-Moral Premises.

##### Counterexample
Presenting one counterexample to test a Moral Premise

##### [[Fallacy]]
Use a Fallacy in order to dismantle an argument
