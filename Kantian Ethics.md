# Kantian Ethics
Example of a [[Deontological Moral Theory]].

*The rightness or wrongness of actions does not depend on their consequences but on whether or not they fulfill their duty.*

## The Categorical Imperative
### First Formulation
**"Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become universal law."**
1. The maxim can be universalized (if everyone can consistently act on the maxim in similar situations).
2. You would be willing to let it happen.

*Perfect Duty (Never)* - not 1 and not 2 (Contradiction in Conception)
*Imperfect Duty (Sometimes)* - 1 and not 2 (Contradiction in Will)
*Morally Permissible (Always)* - 1 and 2 (No Contradiction)

### Second Formulation
**"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end."**
**Mere** means - disregarding someone else's own end

## Criticisms
*Black Rights/White Wrongs* [[Charles W. Mills]] #article

Kant was racist in favor of whites. 

You can't isolate Kant's racism from his ethics in a non-question-begging way. *You cannot call it Kant's Moral theory if you change it.*

"CI: All persons should be treated with respect. GLOSS: "Person" is a technical term, a term of art, signifying beings of a certain level of intelligence and capacity for moral maturity, and on this planet whiteness is a necessary prerequisite for being a person in the full sense"

### 2 Objections
1. We should throw out Kant's Moral theory
2. We should keep Kant's Moral theory, in which case he rambled on for 23 pages (So What?).

#### Responses
1. "If my analysis is correct, then we certainly should throw out **Kant's** moral theory"
2.  Rethink all of western society (Implications to rethinking Kant which is a base of Western Society)
