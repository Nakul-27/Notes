# Price Elasticity
## Price Elasticity of Demand
Price elasticity refers to how the quantity demanded or supplied of a good changes when its price changes. In other words, it measures how much people react to a change in the price of an item.

$PED = \vert\frac{\%\Delta Quantity Demanded}{\% \Delta Price}\vert$
Note that $PED$ is also referred to as *Income Elasticity*.
**ENDPOINT METHOD**
$\% \Delta Q_d = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q_0} = \frac{Q_1 - Q_0}{Q_0}$
$\% \Delta P = \frac{\Delta P}{P_0} = \frac{P_1 - P_0}{P_0}$
**MIDPOINT METHOD**
$\% \Delta Q_d = \frac{Q_1 - Q_0}{(Q_1 + Q_0)/2}$
$\% \Delta P = \frac{P_1 - P_0}{(P_1 + P_0)/2}$
**POINT METHOD**
$PED = \frac{dQ_d}{dP} * \frac{P}{Q_d}$

*Steeper = More Elastic*
*Straight Line = Unit Elastic*

## Price Elasticity of Supply
Price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness to the supply of a good or service after a change in its market price.

$PES = \vert\frac{\%\Delta Quantity Supplied}{\% \Delta Price}\vert$
**ENDPOINT METHOD**
$\% \Delta Q_s = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q_0} = \frac{Q_1 - Q_0}{Q_0}$
$\% \Delta P = \frac{\Delta P}{P_0} = \frac{P_1 - P_0}{P_0}$
**MIDPOINT METHOD**
$\% \Delta Q_s = \frac{Q_1 - Q_0}{(Q_1 + Q_0)/2}$
$\% \Delta P = \frac{P_1 - P_0}{(P_1 + P_0)/2}$
**POINT METHOD**
$PES = \frac{dQ_s}{dP} * \frac{P}{Q_s}$

## Perfect Elasticity
[[Perfectly Elastic]] means that the graph is a horizontal Line
[[Perfectly Inelastic]] means that the graph is a vertical line.

## [[Cross-Price Elasticity]]
Used to measure the responsiveness of one good when the price of another good changes.
