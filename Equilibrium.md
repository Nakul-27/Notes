*At the equilibrium price, the quantity of the good that buyers are willing and able to buy exactly balances the quantity that sellers are willing and able to sell*

*Surplus* - Producers are unable to sell all they want at the going price.
*Shortage* - Producers do not have enough product to sell at the going price.

## [[Law of Supply and Demand]]
The price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded of that good into balance.

Luxury Goods = Veblen Goods (Rolex and Hermes)
Necessary Goods = Giften Goods (Rice and Bread)

### Shift in Supply and Demand
#### Supply:
Increase = Shift Right
Decrease = Shift Left
#### Demand:
Increase = Shift Right
