# Just and Unjust Wars
**Author:** [[Michael Walzer]]

## Chapter 2 - The Crime of War
*Pages:* 21 - 33

The Crime of War is aggression.

War is judged twice:
1. Against the State's reasons for fighting (*Adjectival* - Just or Unjust)
2. The means that they adopt (*Adverbial* - Justly or Unjustly)

*[[Jus ad Bellum]]:* The Justice of War
*[[Jus in Bello]]:* Justice in War
*Note:* Possible for one to exist without the other. 

### The Logic of War
[[Karl von Clausewitz]] writes that "war is an act of force which theoretically can have no limits." 
- The logic of war: Continuous Escalation due to Reciprocal action from the other party. *A Necessity of Nature* meaning that People decide what the logic is. 

### The Limit of Consent
There exists non-hellish war.
- Those who volunteer for war must not think it be hellish. 

Consent exists on spectrum.
- There is a limit of consent in which once crossed, people are forced to fight. 


**War is hell whenever the limit of consent is breached.**

### The Tyranny of War
*Those who resist aggression are forced to imitate and perhaps even exceed, the brutality of the aggressor.*

## Chapter 3 - The Rules of War

### The Moral Equality of Soldiers

### Two Sorts of Rules
Rules of war consist of two clusters of prohibitions:
1. When and How soldiers can kill
2. Whom soldiers can kill

### The War Convention

## Chapter 4 - Law and Order in International Society

### The Theory of Aggression

**Aggression:** Every violation of the territorial integrity or political sovereignty of an independent state.
- **Aggression is the only crime that states can commit against other states.**
	- *Everything else is a misdemeanor.*

#### 6 Propositions
1. There exists an international society of Independent States
2. This international society has a law that establishes the rights of its members - *above all, the rights of territorial integrity and political sovereignty.*
3. Any use of force or imminent threat of force by one state against the political sovereignty or territorial integrity of another constitutes aggression and is a criminal act.
4. Aggression justifies two kinds of violent response:
	1. A war of self-defense by the victim
	2. A war of law-enforcement by the victim and any other member of international society.
5. Nothing but aggression can justify war.
6. Once the aggressor state has been militarily repulsed, it can also be punished.

### The Rights of Political Communities

2 Rights of States:
1. Territorial Integrity
2. Political Sovereignty

When France lost Alsace-Lorraine in the Franco-Prussian war by conceding *with a peace treaty*, it became such that if they tried to retake the territory, that very act would be an act of aggression.

### The Legalist Paradigm

2 Presumptions:
1. Once Aggression has begun, military resistance is favored.
2. When fighting breaks out, there must always be some state against which the law can and should be enforced.
	- ***No war can be just on both sides.*** But there are wars that are just on neither side.

**Imperialist Conflict:** A Conflict that is fought between conquerors and conquerors.
