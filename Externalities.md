# Externalities
A cost or benefit caused by a producer that is not financially incurred or received by that producer. 

*And uncompensated impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander*

**Technical Externality:** An externality that has an impact on the consumption and production opportunities of unrelated third parties, but the price of consumption does not include the externalities.

*Positive Externality:* Market interaction presents a benefit to non-market participants.
*Negative Externality:* Market interaction presents a detriment to non-market participants.

Negative Externalities from Production:
- Where marginal social cost of production is higher than the marginal private cost.
- Example: Air, land, river, and noise pollution that is a result of factory emissions.

Positive Externalities from Consumption:
- Where the marginal social benefit of consumption is higher than the marginal private benefit.
- Examples: Community-access defibrillators, External benefits from a museum.

### Correcting Externalities
Tax Goods when their production generates spillover costs (**Internalizing the Externality**)
- Increases cost of production.
- *Seeks to make the producer pay for the FULL cost of production.*

### Encouraging Externalities
Subsidize Positive Externalities.
- Subsidizing patents for innovations.

### Coase Theorem
In Property Rights disputes, Parties can bargain or negotiate terms to represent full costs and underlying values of the property rights at issue. *This results in the most efficient outcome.*
- Occurs in [[Competitive Markets]].

**Bargain must be costless**

Example:
Factory that produces too much noise for a neighborhood. 

2 Possible Settlements:
1. Business offers financial compensation for the noise pollution.
2. The Business can not produce noise if the residents pay them to do so.

Note that (2) would not happen in the real world since the cost of doing so is higher than the value they place on the absence of the noise.
