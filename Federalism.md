# Federalism
A form of government that divides sovereign power across at least 2 political units. *How do different levels of government interact and how is power divided?*

## Levels of Government
### National
Exclusive powers for national defense and foreign policy. 

### State and Local
Primary responsibility for conducting elections and promoting public safety (Police Powers).

## Federalism in the Constitution
### National Power
The founders wanted a strong national government in order to provide national security and a healthy and efficient economy.

Gave Congress the ability to raise and support armies, declare war, and "suppress Insurrections and repel Invasion." At the same time, the President, as Commander in Chief would oversee the conduct of war.

*Prohibited* states from entering into "any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation" as well as being unable to coin money or impose duties on imports or exports (Article I, Section 10).

**Necessary and Proper Clause** (Article I, Section 8) allowed Congress to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers."
**Commerce Clause** (Article I, Section 8) states that Congress can regulate Interstate Commerce. After *United States v. Lopez*, Congress documented how things related to Interstate Commerce. Now, **Everything is the Commerce Clause**. 
**National Supremacy Clause** (Article VI) states that the laws made under the Constitution are the "supreme law of the land" and it binds judges to the Constitution not the government.

### State Power
In order to balance, many parts of the Constitution sets limits on National power.

**Electoral College Delegates** (Article II) are chosen by the State.
**Amending the Constitution** (Article V) grants the states a central role in that process.

While Congress cannot play state favorites, regulate commerce that happens *within* a state, or impose a tax on any good that's shipped from one state to another. 

**Tenth Amendment** states that all powers not specifically delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.

## Both Perspectives
**Full Faith and Credit Clause** and **Privileges and Immunities Clause** (Article IV) states that States must respect one another's laws.

## Types of Federalism
### Dual Federalism (1789 - 1937)
**Layered Cake** - Separate Roles for each level of Government (Framed using States Rights).

*Dred Scott v. Sandford* in 1857 - Slave owner died and petitioned for freedom under the Missouri Compromise. Upheld that Slaves were people, therefore the Missouri Compromise violated the 5th Amendment because it deprived owners of Property. Essentially said: **States that state law, not federal, determined the legal status of enslaved people.**

### Cooperative Federalism 
**Marbled Cake** (1937 - Present) - Intertwined Roles with each level of Government

**Picket Fence** (1960 - Present) - Each picket of the fence represents a different policy area and the horizontal boards that hold the pickets together represent the different levels of government. *Workers more acquainted with those in their topic rather than those on their level (Ex: Transportation vs National).*

### Fiscal Federalism (1937 - Present)
Deals with the division of governmental function and financial relations among levels of government.

[[Categorical Grants]] and [[Block Grants]]

### Coercive Federalism (1970 - Present)
Involves the federal preemptions of state and local authority and [[Unfunded Mandates]] on state and local governments to force states to change their policies to match national goals or policies established by Congress.

### Competitive Federalism
Competition among states to provide the best policies to attract businesses, create jobs, and maintain an healthy social fabric.

Can create "race to the bottom" as states attempt to lure businesses by keeping taxes and social spending low.
