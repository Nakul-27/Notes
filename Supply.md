### Sudden Increases in Supply
[[Herd Mentality]] which causes people to feel something like "Mass Fomo".
If purchasing said item is *Low-Risk* then it makes it easier for people to rationalize purchasing

#### Inability to meet Supply
Split [[Supply Chain]] (Consumer vs Industrial Level)

#### [[Price Gouging]]
Occurs when there is a sudden increase in Demand and prices increase to meet supply.

Something like 77% of Economists are in favor over an [[Artificial Cap]] in prices.
