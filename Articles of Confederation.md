# Articles of Confederation

**Too Decentralized and Too Limited**

No provisions for President or any other executive leader. **All national power went to [[Congress]] with each state having a single vote.** All legal matters were left to the states. *Matters between states would be resolved by special panels of judges appointed on an as-needed basis by Congress.*

9 out of 13 states to approve changes to the Articles and each state got veto power. 

No taxation or central currency. (Congress tried to tax but Rhode Island vetoed).

Foreign countries had to negotiate with each state due to veto powers.

Barely able to put down [[Shays' Rebellion]] which exposed weaknesses of the Articles
