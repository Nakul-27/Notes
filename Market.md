# Market
A Market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service.
- Buyers (as a group) determine the demand for the product
- Sellers (as a group) determine the supply of the product

### **Perfectly Competitive Market**
1. Goods offered for sale are all exactly the same
2. The buyers and seller are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price.
3. Perfect information - buyers and sellers know everything about each other.
4. No barriers to entry - free entry and exit within the market. 

Since buyers and sellers *accept* the price that the market determines, they are **price takers**.

### Monopoly
Markets that have only one seller (Standard Oil)
