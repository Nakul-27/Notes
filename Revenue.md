# Revenue
## Total Revenue
$TR = P * Q_d$
Total Revenue = Price * Quantity Demanded

In order to determine whether you should raise or lower price, you need to know whether the demand is elastic or inelastic. If demand is elastic with price elasticity greater than 1, a decline in the price will increase total revenue. If demand is inelastic with price elasticity less than 1, an increase in the price of admissions will cause total revenue to rise.
