# Bureaucracy
The vast network of agencies that make up the government's executive branch. 

## Developing Regulations
**Regulation:** A rule that allows the government to exercise control over individuals and corporations by allowing or prohibiting behavior, setting out the conditions under which certain behaviors can occur, or assessing costs or granting benefits based on behavior. 

*Notice and Comment Procedure:* Proposed regulations are published by the Federal Register. Then people can comment on the regulations or respond to the agency that proposed it. Also they can appeal to Congress or the President's staff for lobbying. The agency issues a final regulation in the Federal Register. 

## Problem of Control
**Principle and Agent Problem:** Interaction between a group ("agent") that acts on behalf of another ("principal"). The issue is that giving the agent specific orders prevents them from using their expertise, but allowing them full freedom gives them the ability to act in their own self-interests. 
- Agents: Federal Government, [[The Presidency]], [[Congress]] and bureaucrats

**Regulatory Capture:** occurs when Bureaucrats cater to a small group of people.

## Growth of Bureaucracy Over Time
*Spoils System:* Erected under Andrew Jackson in which people who supported the political organization were placed in positions of Bureaucratic power. 

*Progressive Era:* Saw the passing of acts such as the Pure Food Drug Act of 1906 and the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890. Passing of the 1883 Pendleton Civil Service Act which was a **Merit Based System.**

*New Deal and Great Society:* New Deal under FDR Increased Bureaucracy greatly. The Great Society under LBJ saw to the expansion of civil rights and domestic bureaucracy. 

*Reagan and Onwards:* Saw to the rolling back of reforms in 1980. After Carter, Reagan campaigned for getting Government out of people's lives as they weren't doing anything. 

## Controlling the Bureaucracy
**Bureaucratic Drift:** Bureaucrats acting in their own rights. 

### Oversight
Numerous committees in Congress to oversee bureaucracy and "ensure" that instances like the 2008 financial crisis don't happen again.
