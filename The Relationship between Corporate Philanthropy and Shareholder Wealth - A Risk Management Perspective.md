# The Relationship between Corporate Philanthropy and Shareholder Wealth - A Risk Management Perspective
**3 Core Assertions**
1. Corporate philanthropy can generate positive moral capital among communities and stakeholders.
2. Moral capital can provide shareholders with insurance-like protection for a firm's relationship-based intangible assets.
3. The protection contributes to shareholder wealth.

## Abstract
Link between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate financial Performance (CFP).

Philanthropic activity anchors one end of the pathway, shareholder wealth the other. 

*Philanthropic Activity:* An unconditional transfer of cash or other assets to an entity or a settlement or cancellation of its liabilities in a voluntary **non-reciprocal transfer** by another entity acting other than as an owner. 
**Note that the non-reciprocity condition has become the acid test of philanthropic activity**

## Literature Review
### CSR-CFP Debate

One side believes that there should be no relation between CSR and CFP (Pure Capitalists)

*Strategic Philanthropy:* Although a firm receives no tangible, explicit, or discrete exchange value, philanthropic and other CSR activities generate intangible strategic assets like reputational capital, employee commitment, trust, or acquiescence among key regulatory institutions or legislative bodies, or the development of the firm's business and institutional environments.

## Strategic Philanthropy

### How Much Should a Firm Invest in Philanthropic Activity
No clear estimate, however we can take a risk management perspective to aid in the creation of a stopping rule.

## Strategic Philanthropy: Creating Shareholder Wealth

### From Philanthropic Activity to Moral Capital
We can define a firm's global reputation as "the overall estimation of a company held by its constituents."
- This can be considered an assessments of the *attributes* of the firm. 

**Moral Capital:** Philanthropic moral reputations capital.

Premise: "That philanthropic activity generates a positive reputation and subsequent positive moral capital is, prima facie, true; good and beneficent acts that go above and beyond the call of duty *should* result in approbation rather than condemnation, for one *definiens* of a good act is that it engenders approbation among observers."

**Note that for philanthropic activity to qualify as a good act, it must be consistent with some underlying ethical value.**

#### Proposition 1
- **1a:** The greater the level of consistency between philanthropic activity and a community's ethical values, the greater that positive moral evaluation among that community.
- **1b:** The greater the level of opposition between philanthropic activity and a community's ethical values, the greater the negative moral evalulation among that community. 
- **1c:** Philanthropic activity that is neutral toward a community's values will generate a neutral moral evaluation among that community.

#### Proposition 2
- **2a:** The greater the extent to which philanthropic activity is viewed by a community as a genuine manifestation of the firm's intentions, motivations, and character, the greater the positive moral evaluation will be among that community.
- **2b:** The greater the extent to which philanthropic activity is viewed by a community as an ingratiating attempt to win favor, the greater the negative moral evaluation will be among that community.
#### Proposition 3
- **3a:** The greater the act-based positive moral evaluation, the greater the actor-based positive moral evaluation by a target community, the greater the positive moral capital generated by the philanthropic activity will be.
