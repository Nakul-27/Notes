# Microeconomics

## Externalities
**Externality:** A cost or benefit caused by a producer that is not financially incurred or received by that producer. *Can stem from either production or consumption.*

## Types of Goods
**Rival:** The Good is scarce.

**Exclusive:** There exists a barrier to entry.

**Public Good:** Commodities or services that are made available to all members of a society. Non-rival and Non-excludable

**Private Good:** Goods that are both excludable and rivalrous. Good that have to be purchased before consumption.

**Club Good:**  Goods that are excludable but non-rival. Individuals can be prevented from consuming them, but their consumption does not reduce their availability to other individuals. 

**Common Resources:** Goods that are non-excludable but are rival. This means that people cannot be prevented from getting them, but the good is scarce.

### Free-Rider Problem
An Example of [[Market Failure]].
**Free-Rider Problem:** The Burden on a shared resource that is created by its use or overuse by people who aren't paying their fair share.

Requirements to Occur:
1. Good must be non-excludable
2. Good must be non-rival
3. Someone has to maintain the good. 

#### Solutions
Good can be taxed by the Government or the good can be turned into a private or club good. 

### Tragedy of the Commons
**Tragedy of the Commons:** A problem in which every individual has an incentive to consume a resource , but at the expense of every other individual -- *with no way to exclude anyone from consuming.* Can lead to *total depletion* of a resource. 

Requirements to Occur:
1. Good must be non-excludable.
2. Good must be rivalrous. 

#### Solutions
Good can be regulated by Government (hunting/fishing licenses) or legally exclude some individuals from the good. 

## Cost of Production
### Fixed Costs
Expenses that do not change with the amount of output produced

#### Sunk Cost Fallacy
The tendency to follow through on an endeavor if we've already invested in it, despite the costs outweighing the benefits.

**Fixed Costs are Sunk**

### Variable Costs
Costs that change with the changes in the level of production

### Total Cost
$TC = FC + VC$

**In the Long Run, Total Cost is the Variable Costs**

**Long Run:** Accumulated when firms change production levels over time in response to expected economic profits or losses. *No fixed factors of production.*

**Short Run:** Accumulated in real time throughout the production process. 

### Average Cost
$AC = \frac{TC}{\# \text{ of Units}}$ 

#### Average Fixed Cost
$AFC = \frac{TFC}{\# \text{ of Units}}$ 

#### Average Variable Cost
$AVC = \frac{TVC}{\# \text{ of Units}}$ 

When $AVC$ are rising, it means that $MC > AVC$, so $MC$ are pulling up the $AVC$.

**Goal is to minimize the average cost per unit so that it can increase the profit margin without increasing costs.**

### Marginal Cost
$MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$

When $P = MC$, it is the socially optimal quantity.

### Revenue
$TR = (p_1q_1) + (p_2q_2) + \ldots + (p_nq_n)$ 

### Marginal Revenue
$MR = \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}$

*Marginal Revenue for competitive firms is typically constant.*

**Perfectly competitive firms maximize profits when marginal costs equal market price and marginal revenue**

**For Monopolies, marginal revenue diminishes with each additional unit and will always be equal to or less than average revenue.**

## Economies of Scale
Describes how quickly output rises as inputs increase.

Phases of Long-run $ATC$ Curves
1. Increasing Returns to Scale: Refers to a production process where an increase in the number of units produced causes a decrease in the average cost of each unit. *(Economies of Scale)*
2. Constant Return to Scale: Refers to production for which the average costs of output increase as the level or production increase.
3. Diminishing Return to Scale: Refers to production for which the average costs of output increase as the level of production increases. *(Diseconomies of Scale)*
