# Pyramid of Pain
![[Pasted image 20211118112516.png]]
**Higher up on the Pyramid = More difficult to figure out**
**If something higher up on the pyramid is figured out, it's more difficult to change.**
Ex: Learning your organizations hash values have been figured out? Change Hash Values. Learning your organizations Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) have been figured out? Much harder to change.
