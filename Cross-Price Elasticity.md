# Cross-Price Elasticity
Formula:
$$
\begin{align*}
E_y^x &= \frac{\%\Delta Q_x}{\%\Delta P_y}\\
	  &= \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_x}{Q_x}}{\frac{\Delta P_y}{P_y}} \\
	  &= \frac{\Delta Q_x}{\Delta P_y} * \frac{P_y}{Q_x}
\end{align*}
$$
## Substitute Goods
$E_y^x$ is positive meaning that demand for one good increases as the price of its substitute increases.

Ex: Demand for tea increases as price for coffee increases.

## Complementary Goods
$E_y^x$ is negative meaning that as the price for one good increases, the demand for the other decreases.

Ex: Demand for coffee stirs decrease as
