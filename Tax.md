# Tax
The equilibrium quantity produced, the amount consumers pay, and the amount producers receive for each unit of product are independent of who pays the tax. 
**Tax Levied on Consumers: Shift in Demand Curve by the amount of the tax**
**Tax Levied on Producers: Shift in the Supply Curve by the amount of the tax**

## Per-Unit Tax
Can be found by subtracting the Post-Tax Price on the Demand Curve and the Post-Tax Price on the Supply Curve
Ex: ![[Pasted image 20220130102820.png]]
$Per-Unit$ $Tax$ $= 28.00 - 16.00 = 12.00$.
## Tax Wedge
Can be found by either
	1. Placing on a graph (Count number of dollars between demand and supply curves)
	2. Using $Q_S = Q_D$. Add tax to $p$ for Demand. Subtract tax from $p$ for Supply.
		1. Ex: $Q_S = 5p_s$ and $Q_D = 100 - 5p_c$ 
			Equilibrium: $p = 10\$$ and $Quantity = 50$
			4$ Excise Tax: $Q_S = Q_D$
			Supply: $5(p-4) = 100-5p$ (Upper Value)
			Demand: $5p = 100-5(p+4)$ (Lower Value)

Used to demonstrate the idea that sometimes cutting taxes can result in increased total tax revenue.
