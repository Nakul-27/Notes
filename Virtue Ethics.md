# Virtue Ethics
A [[Moral Theory]] that makes virtue the central concern. *Concerned with the whole of a parson's life, rather than particular episodes or actions.*

*Person rather than action based: it looks at the virtue or moral character of the person carrying out an action, rather than at ethical duties and rules, or the consequences of particular actions.*

Where Utilitarian or Kantian ethicist asks "What should I *do*?", the **Virtue Ethicist asks "What should I *be*?"**

**Act out of Respect instead out of a sense of duty.**

## The Ethics of Virtue
[[Aristotle]]: Life is teleological meaning that we aren't meant to *be* something but to *aspire towards* something.

**Eudaemonia**: Happiness or flourishing

**Virtue**: a stable disposition to act and feel according to some ideal or model of excellence. It is a deeply embedded character trait that can affect actions in countless situations.

### Golden Mean 
*A balance between two behavioral extremes.*
**Comes Out of Habit**
**The Golden Mean might be closer to one extreme rather than in the middle**
Ex: Recklessness and Cowardice
The Golden mean would be closer to recklessness rather than in the middle since the middle could represent inaction.

## Criticism
Virtue Ethics is Circular Logic.
