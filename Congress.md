# Congress
## Founding
[[Federalist Papers]] No. 57 made it clear that the new government was not a direct democracy.

Senate was made to check the House (More Responsive).

*Senate is more Insulated than the House (6-year terms vs 2-year terms)*

**Pork Barrel Legislation:** Legislation that is stuffed with things for representatives constituents since they *need* to be passed. 
- "Credit Claiming" occurs when a member of Congress takes Credit for something that is of value to their voters. 
- "Position Taking" refers to any public statement about a topic of interest to constituents or interest groups (Ex: Don Wagner's statements about Gavin Newsome).

## Types of Representation
**Descriptive Representation:** Occurs when members of Congress "look like" their constituents.

**Substantive Representation:** involves *how* the member serves constituents' interests. 2 Models:
1. Trustee: Represents the interests of the constituents from a distance, weighing multiple concerns. (Responsible)
2. Delegate: Carries out the direct desires of the voters. (Responsive)

**Politico:** Act like a delegate on issues that are highly salient to his/her constituency but a trustee on less salient or more complex issues (foreign Policy).

## Reelection
Cost of Focus on Reelection:
1. Perception that Congress has granted itself too many special privileges aimed at securing reelection.
2. Evidence suggests that some voters question the value of pork-barrel spending, even when it targets their district
3. Members' desire to please means that Congress has a difficult time refusing any groups' demands, which may lead to passage of contradictory policies
4. Given that most members are experts at getting reelected, they achieve a certain level of independence from the party leadership - that is, they do not depend on party leaders for their reelection. This fact contributes to the fragmentation of Congress and creates difficulties for congressional leaders as they attempt to shepherd policies through the legislative maze.
5. Time spent actively campaigning takes time away from responsibilities of enacting laws and overseeing their implementation.

## Redistricting
Done by the State Government
### Gerrymandering
Redistricting in such as away as to give a significant advantage to one side.

#### Partisan Gerrymandering
Gerrymandering that benefits one party

#### Racial Gerrymandering
Gerrymandering that places minority legislative candidates at a disadvantage.

## Structure
### Committee System
#### Standing Committee
Draft legislation and oversee the implementation of laws they pass. 

Ex: Agriculture Committees, Judiciary, Rules, etc.

#### Select Committee
Address specific topic for one or two terms.

Ex: Select Committee on January 6th Attack

#### Joint Committees
Committee made up of people from both parties. 

#### Conference Committee
Formed as needed to resolve specific legislative differences between the House and Senate. 

## Passing Bills
![[Pasted image 20220227222046.png]]
**80-90 Percent of bills die at the sub/committee stage as they never make it out.**
- Markup is the collaborative process of determining the final language of the bill.

**Bills that appropriates Money bust go through a two-step process of authorization and appropriation.**
- Authorization determines the language of the bill and merits
- Appropriation involves the Budget Committees in both the House and Senate setting overall guidelines for the national budget, and the Appropriations Committees in the two chambers determining the actual amount of money that will be spent. 

### Differences between House and Senate
1. The continuity of the membership and the impact this has on the rules.
2. The way in which bills get to the floor.
3. The structure of the floor process, including debates and amendments. 

More rules in the House than the Senate
- House easier to Navigate

### Filibuster
Openly "debating" a bill to death if 40 Senators agree.
**Debate may be cut off only if 60 Senators agree.**
- This is known as **Invoking Cloture.**
