### [[Surplus]]
Also known as a [[Downward Pressure on Prices]] when the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded at a given Price (Below Equilibrium).
### [[Consumer Surplus]] and [[Producer Surplus]]
Both combine to create [[Total Surplus]]

## [[Price Ceiling]] and [[Price Floor]]
**Binding** means that the price is set either below (Ceiling) or above (Floor) the [[Equilibrium Price]]

### [[Rationing and Incentives]]
