# Constitution
Before the Constitution, there were the [[Articles of Confederation]]

**Purposefully Ambiguous.**

### Preamble
"We the People of the United States" vs "We the undersigned delegates of the States" from the Articles of Confederation.

### In the [[Declaration of Independence]]
*"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government."*

## [[Political Theories]] of the Framers of the Constitution
**3 Key Principles**
1. Popular Control of Government through Republican Democracy
2. A Rejection of Monarchy
3. Limitations on Government power that would protect individual rights and personal property.

## [[Federalist Papers]]
Justified the framework of the government created by the Constitution.

## Federalist vs Antifederalist
Federalist - Empower National Government
Antifederalist - Strong state government and weak national government.

Differences between Articles and Constitution.

Ultimately debated at during the [[Constitutional Convention]].

### Ratification
[[Antifederalists]] worried about the role of the President. 

Ensured the addition of the [[Bill of Rights]] (First 10 Amendments).

## Exclusive Powers Granted by the Constitution
Sharing of Powers is [[Federalism]].
### Congress
"First Branch" - A lot of Exclusive Powers
- Raise revenue for the federal government through taxation and borrowing.
- Regulate Interstate and foreign commerce.
- Coin Money
- Establish Post Offices and roads
- Grant Patents and Copyrights
- Create a system of federal courts
- Declare war, "raise and support armies," make rules for the military, and create and maintain a navy.
- **Power of the Purse** - Control over Taxation and Spending (Article I, Section 8).
- **Necessary and Proper Clause** - Allows Congress the flexibility to pass laws related to any of its exclusive powers.
	- Example: The Draft isn't explicitly stated but Congress needs to raise a standing army.

### President
Very Limited Exclusive Powers
- Commander in Chief
- Receive Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers
- Issue Pardons

### Courts
Very Little Attention
[[Federalist Papers]] No. 78 argued that the Supreme Court was the "least dangerous branch."
**Judicial Review came later in *Marbury v. Madison***

## Shared Powers
 - War Powers - President is the Commander in Chief but Congress has ability to declare war as well as fund the military. *Ensures that the Military is run by the people.*
	 - Expansion of the Presidents power though because if the President wants to go to war, either Congress has to go along or get out of the way.
		 - Shown by 2003 Invasion of Iraq or Former Pres. Trump's Strikes against ISIS in Syria.

## Negative/Checking Powers
- Congressional Checks - Power of the Purse and Impeachment
- Presidential Checks - Veto
- Supreme Court - Judicial Review (*Marbury v. Madison* in 1803)

## [[Articles of the Constitution]]
7 Articles that come before the Amendments

## Changing the Constitution
*Article V* - Formal Process for Amending the Constitution
### [[Amendments]]
### Propose
1. Congress may *propose* an amendment by $\frac{2}{3}$ of the members in both houses.
2. A National Convention that has been called by $\frac{2}{3}$ of the state legislatures (has only been used for the 21st Amendment)
### Ratification
1. *Ratified* by either $\frac{3}{4}$ of the states' legislatures 
2. *Ratified* by either $\frac{3}{4}$ of the states conventions
